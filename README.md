# Mini Project: Li-Fi Communication System  

**Institute:** IIT Guwahati  
**Duration:** Jan â€“ May 2025  

## Overview  
This project explored the concept of **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)** as an alternative to traditional Wi-Fi.  
A simple communication system was built using an **LED as a transmitter** and a **photodiode as a receiver**, demonstrating short-range data transfer through visible light.  

## Key Features  
- Implemented a basic circuit for optical data transmission.  
- Tested data clarity and range using simple signals.  
- Gained hands-on experience with electronics lab instruments (CRO, function generator, photodiode).  

## Outcome  
Successfully demonstrated short-distance data transfer through light.
